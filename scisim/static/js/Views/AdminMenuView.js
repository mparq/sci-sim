/**
 * Define a view on AdminMenu. This will be used by AdminMenuRenderer to get
 * the html template based on choices of menu. Right now, this is a little bit
 * overkill because 1) menu should be relatively static and thus we don't really
 * need a reference to it here. However, in the future, we could keep track of
 * possibly disabled choices or other changing metadata about the menu.
 * 2) Assumedly, the AdminMenu will only have this one view, so the AdminMenuRenderer
 * could just do this work. However, other Renderers will probably have different
 * views that they will need to switch between, so just to keep it consistent
 * we should create a separate View for the AdminMenu as well.
