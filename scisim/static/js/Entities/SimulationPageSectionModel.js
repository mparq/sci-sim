/**
 * Holds information about a PageSection.
 *
 * This model is interesting and we may
 * want to modify how it currently looks. In the database, we only have generic
 * page sections which have a content field containing the raw html that should
 * be placed into the section. We do need some abstract concept of a section so
 * that we can order the sections properly on the page, however it might be desirable
 * to have different types of page sections. This will be especially useful in the
 * SimulationEditor because when editing, the user will be choosing between
 * different types of sections anyway, rather than working with raw html.
 *
 * This reorganization of the model is a TODO for now. The current main gripe is
 * that the current model forces either the application to know how to transform
 * different "types" of sections into the right content or force the model to
 * expose different functions for parsing content based on type, which is how the
 * model is currently implemented.
