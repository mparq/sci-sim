saveitall (2),"I believe that the dolphins are dying off because of the sonar testing. The manatees are probably dying because of boat propellers and lack of sea grasses. The pelicans could be dying because the fish they are eating are contaminated. All in all, people are the cause for these deaths.",Manatees,"My team chose the manatee because they are easiest to get close to for research and because they are also extremely endangered. We also chose the manatee because they are directly dependent on sea grass, which means that studying the manatees could give us some insight into the sea grass problem as well.","My hypothesis is that if manatees are getting killed by boats and lack of sea grass, then if you create sanctuaries were there are no boats and there is an abundance of sea grass, then the manatees there will not die as quickly as the manatees outside of the sanctuary.","My rationale for choosing this hypothesis is that if you take away what is killing the manatees, then they won't die of anything other then old age.",I would like to test my hypothesis by creating a sanctuary for the manatees and then observing the populations both in and outside of the sanctuary.,Seagrass Examination,"We will look for a lacking in sea grass or a prop scar.

                                                              Why?Sea grass is the manatees main food source, so if they don't have as much sea grass they won't be able to eat as much. Therefore, they will all die.
                                                              Since manatees eat over 100 pounds of seagrass everyday, other than loss of seagrass, how else could seagrass contribute to manatee deaths?If the sea grass they  eat is in any way contaminated by pollutants then they will be poisoned and will all die.

That indicates that their natural food source, the sea grass, is lacking. Also it seems that there is a connection between their eating of Gracilaria and their indications of drowning. Our hypothesis is supported in the way that we know they do not have enough sea grass but it is refuted in the way that the sea grass wasn't really contaminated.

                                                              What does this graph tell you:the amount of sea grass have raised since 1986-2009, and it seems to just suddenly decrease in the year of 2009
                                                              Do you think the loss of seagrass is contributing to the unusual mortality event?no, 
                                                              Why?the reason the sea grass haven't grown is something in that environment that have stopped its growth, which could be the cause of the unusual mortality
                                                              Since manatees eat over 100 pounds of seagrass everyday, other than loss of seagrass, how else could seagrass contribute to manatee deaths?the seagrass have been polluted by something in that area, which have been affected the manatees
                                                              How would you test to see if that is the cause?i would go pull samples of seagrass and run some test on it ,to see if there is something that should not be there",Analyze Water Quality,is the water safe enough to have as an habitat , Do you think water quality is contributing to the UME?yes,,,,,,,,,,,that the growth sea grass have dcreased,the water quailty have also change over the years,supported,there where things that change in the environment the manatees  have been living in that help supported my hypothesis,the sea grass that the manatees usually eat everyday was decreasing because there was something decreasing its growth,yes what i have concluded ia specific,its specfic because  i knew that something in its habitat could be causing their deaths,it could be the same,because there is something in the eniviroment always killing the species
silly girls (99),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
silly girlss (100),i think that pollution in water is causing unusual mortality in the Indian River lagoon. It's also stopping the animals from living there.,Bottlenose Dolphins,Because majority of them die everyday and they have the most death rate,i think that they will become more extinct everyday.,because of the information that was given.,research,Investigate Algal Blooms,what's causing it to bloom, Do you think algal blooms are contributing to the UME?yes because they are becoming more populated ,Look for Invasive Species,"identity, the family", Do you think invasive species are contributing to the UME? Why?yes because they are not related to the rest of them and they may be one reason of causing the animals to die,,,,,,,,,,,the hypothesis is correct,more animals would become extinct also,Supported,it showed the different things that caused the dolphins to die.,high death rates,Both,because the dolphins are not living due to the fact of species that's unknown,Same,because the death rates are alike in animals
122803 (101),I believe that the toxins that are dumped in the water is a major contribution to the death of the sea creatures. It's basically suffocating the animals and poisoning them.,Bottlenose Dolphins,"They are the most important on focus on because they are a major contribution to the sea life. They are both predator and prey, so when they are dying by unofficial 'nature', it throws the eating system off. Other animals start to die out due to starvation, while other animals bloom in population.",Bottlenose dolphins are dying out due to the bio-toxins that are dumped into the streams.,Bio-toxins are a major contribution to the extinction of wildlife.,Experiment in a concealed part of the estuary with the dolphins and the toxins.,Necropsy of Affected Dolphins,Behavior changes as well as eating habits., Conclusions:The blood tests showed that the dangerous toxins/poisons created by industrial waste wasn't present in the blood.,Look for Invasive Species,mutated sea creatures," Do you think invasive species are contributing to the UME? Why?I do believe that because the foreign and wild animals are contributing to the U.M.E. The wild animals don't belong in that specific region, therefore they mess up the flow and attack other animals.",Analyze Water Quality,"clear, shallow, livable.", Do you think water quality is contributing to the UME?The water could be contributing to the U.M.E. because it can be getting deprived of oxygen and have too much salt.,,,,,,,,I actually didn't make any observations that contributed to my hypothesis.,The water's salinity and oxygen levels.,Refuted,It was refuted because the dangerous bio-toxins didn't affect the dolphins at all.,It has to deal with the water and other unidentified causes.,I believe it's specific to other species as well.,It's not because dolphins aren't the only species the live in an estuary.,same,same
1037913 (102),some of the organisms can not survive in salt and fresh water.,Bottlenose Dolphins,dolphins are beautiful mammals. people actually pay lump somes of money just to be around them.,"if you cut off the fresh water flowing into lagoon, than the dolphins will have a better chance at living",dolphins live in salt water so the fresh water throws there bodies off ,use 2 dolphins. put one in fresh water and one in salt water and see who lives longer ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

                                                              What does this graph tell you:In 2011, the seagrass started to decreased , but fom 1986 to 2009 the sea was up and down.
                                                              Do you think the loss of seagrass is contributing to the unusual mortality event?Yes
                                                              Why?Their was a lot of manatees to feed seagreen to and it started to decrease.
                                                              Since manatees eat over 100 pounds of seagrass everyday, other than loss of seagrass, how else could seagrass contribute to manatee deaths?They probably was not getting enough to eat. 
                                                              How would you test to see if that is the cause?Take 2 manatees and feed one manatees 100 pounds of seagrass and the other 10 pounds of seagrass.",,,,,,,,,,,"It May Have Been the Seagrass , Water , or Possibly Chokng of Things that has came out the water   ",It was true ,Supported ,Cause i had a feeling that it was dealing with the food or etc ,That it was the food they was taking in ,"Both , to manatees and other species ",Some other species are dying the same way too,It can be the same and it also be different ,I believe that it is the same and different
